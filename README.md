What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language widely used to create interactive web pages. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. JavaScript code is executed by the web browser, allowing for dynamic content, user interactions, and rich web applications.
Key Features of JavaScript:

    Dynamic Typing: Variables can hold values of different data types without explicit declaration.
    Object-Oriented Programming: JavaScript supports object-oriented concepts like objects, properties, and methods.
    Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript uses asynchronous programming to handle tasks without blocking the execution of other code.
    DOM Manipulation: JavaScript can interact with HTML elements and modify their content, style, and behavior.
    Event Handling: It allows you to respond to user actions like clicks, key presses, and mouse movements.
    AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML enables communication with servers without reloading the entire page.

Getting Started:

    Text Editor or IDE: Choose a suitable text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

    HTML File: Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) to structure your web page.

    JavaScript File: Create a JavaScript file (e.g., script.js) to write your JavaScript code.

    Link the Files: In your HTML file, use the <script> tag to link the JavaScript file:
    HTML

    <script src="script.js"></script>


Basic JavaScript Concepts:

    Variables: Declare variables using var, let, or const to store values.
    Data Types: JavaScript has various data types like numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and more.
    Operators: Perform operations using arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
    Control Flow: Use if, else, else if, switch, for, while, and do-while statements to control the flow of your code.
    Functions: Define functions to encapsulate reusable code blocks.
    Objects: Create objects to represent real-world entities with properties and methods.
    Arrays: Store collections of values in an ordered sequence.
